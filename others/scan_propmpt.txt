Hellou! I need to write code for an interesting task.
I'm pentesting some of my bluetooth devices.  Using `bluetoothctl` I want to scan devices and get just mobile phones.
Based on MAC address is there any way to know which is phone?

Sample of bluetoothctl output
```
[DEL] Device 78:2B:64:4F:BB:D9 LE-Bose Micro SoundLink
[CHG] Device 5D:7C:EA:27:7F:C2 RSSI: -38
[CHG] Device 5D:7C:EA:27:7F:C2 RSSI: -48
[CHG] Device FF:19:94:66:E9:39 RSSI: -47
[CHG] Device 5D:7C:EA:27:7F:C2 RSSI: -38

I know that the first six digits are associated with a manufacturer.
I that regard I can create a local json file that stores key-value pairs of 6 digits and manufactirer name. Currently I have this:
I have a json file that stores manufacturer name and a hexadecimal same as `ManufacturerData Key`

```JSON
[
    {
        "name": "Codie LLC",
        "value": "0x0EC8"
    },
    {
        "name": "Canyon Bicycles GmbH",
        "value": "0x0EC7"
    },
    {
        "name": "AuthGate B.V.",
        "value": "0x0EC6"
    },
    {
        "name": "Alibaba (China) Co., Ltd.",
        "value": "0x0EC5"
    },
```
I'm running on linux Debian 12. I have python3, and bluettotgctl installed and working. Also hcitools.
My bluetooth adapter is a SENA udm100 with a 8dbi antenna.
I assume that a python script can automate the process of scanning bluetooth devices, extracting data of interest, maping to a json file and returning and array or list of macaddresss
to which a callback function must be applied, kindo of map.

//
Using a Bluetooth adaptor  I want to scan devices in my own space and make a list / array of the ones that belong to type 'mobile phone'. How can this be achieved? I run on Linux Debian 12, have bluetoothctl, blueman, bluez, ...  I want to use python. I have a SENA UDM100 usb adapter with 8dbi antenna.
